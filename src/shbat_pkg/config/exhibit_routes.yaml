# Exhibit Routes Configuration
# 
# This file defines:
# 1. Exhibits - named locations with coordinates
# 2. Routes - predefined paths between exhibits (via waypoints)
#
# The robot follows these routes instead of using the default path planner,
# ensuring it takes sensible paths and avoids awkward areas.

# Named exhibit locations
exhibits:
  entrance:
    x: 0.0
    y: 0.0
    yaw: 0.0

  exhibit_a:
    x: 3.0
    y: 1.5
    yaw: 1.57

  exhibit_b:
    x: 5.0
    y: 0.0

    x: 5.0
    y: -2.0

# Predefined routes between exhibits
# Each route is a list of intermediate waypoints (coordinates)
# The robot follows these waypoints in order to reach the destination
#
# Format: "from->to": [[x1,y1,yaw1], [x2,y2,yaw2], ...]
# If no route defined, robot will use direct navigation

routes:
  # From entrance to exhibits
  "entrance->exhibit_a":
    - [1.5, 0.5, 0.5]    # Turn right at corridor
    - [2.5, 1.0, 1.0]    # Approach exhibit area
    
  "entrance->exhibit_b":
    - [2.0, 0.0, 0.0]    # Go straight down main corridor
    - [4.0, 0.0, 0.0]    # Continue
    
  "entrance->exhibit_c":
    - [2.0, 0.0, 0.0]    # Go straight
    - [4.0, 0.0, -0.5]   # Turn right
    - [5.0, -1.0, -1.57] # Head to exhibit C

  "entrance->exhibit_d":
    - [1.0, -1.0, -1.57] # Turn left
    - [1.5, -2.0, 3.14]  # Navigate around obstacle

  # Between exhibits
  "exhibit_a->exhibit_b":
    - [4.0, 1.0, -0.5]   # Exit A, head towards B
    
  "exhibit_b->exhibit_c":
    - [5.0, -1.0, -1.57] # Go down from B to C
    
  "exhibit_c->exhibit_d":
    - [4.0, -2.0, 3.14]  # Head west
    - [3.0, -2.5, 3.14]  # Continue to D

  "exhibit_d->entrance":
    - [1.0, -1.5, 1.0]   # Head back
    - [0.5, -0.5, 0.5]   # Approach entrance

# Default tour order

  - entrance
