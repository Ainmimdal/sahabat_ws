# ZED Depth to LaserScan Configuration
# Converts ZED depth image to virtual laser scan for obstacle detection
#
# This creates a "virtual LIDAR" from the ZED camera that:
# - Sees obstacles the physical LIDAR might miss (different height)
# - Provides front-facing obstacle detection
# - Works alongside the 360° LIDAR for full coverage

# Parameters for depthimage_to_laserscan node
# Scan timing (should match ZED frame rate)
scan_time: 0.067  # ~15 Hz to match ZED grab rate

# Range limits (match ZED depth settings)
range_min: 0.3    # ZED minimum depth
range_max: 8.0    # Practical max for indoor use

# Which row(s) of the depth image to use for the scan
# Higher = looks at floor level, Lower = looks higher
# ZED 2i VGA is 376 rows, center is ~188
# We scan slightly below center to catch floor-level obstacles
scan_height: 10   # Use 10 rows for more robust detection

# Output frame (will be set by launch file)
output_frame: "zed_left_camera_frame"
