### Laser Scan Filter Configuration
### 
### Filters out specific angle ranges where robot frame beams are detected.
### Angles are measured counter-clockwise from front of robot:
###   Front = 0°
###   Left = 90°
###   Back = ±180°
###   Right = -90° (or 270°)
###
### Adjust the filter_zones based on your robot's beam positions!

    # Range filters - IMPORTANT for noise reduction
    min_range: 0.10      # 10cm - ignore very close readings (robot body + noise)
    max_range: 8.0       # 8m - reduced from 12m, far readings are noisy
    
    # Intensity filter (if your LIDAR supports it)
    # min_intensity: 100  # Ignore weak reflections
    
    # Filter zones as flat list: [start1, end1, start2, end2, ...]
    # Each pair is [start_angle_deg, end_angle_deg]
    # Readings in these zones will be set to infinity (ignored)
    # 
    # For 2040 beams on left and right of LIDAR:
    # Left beam: 80 to 100 degrees
    # Right beam: -100 to -80 degrees (or 260 to 280)
    filter_zones: [80.0, 100.0, -100.0, -80.0]
